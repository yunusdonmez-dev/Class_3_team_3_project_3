Infotech data science course - Project-3

We wrote a program where we design the interface with pyqt5, get the instant weather conditions with the api, and get the information of the selected city with scrapy and save it to mongo db.

We wrote this program in python.

We got the state, region and population information in the Netherlands, America and Germany from wikipedia.

We kept this information in the tables which we created with mongo db.

User can selected a country and city.

When the program was run, it first listed the registered cities as a list on a table widget.

Then we chose one of the cities listed.

According to this selection, we got the instant weather information using the API.

We saw the instant weather in our interface with a background picture suitable for the weather.

We completed our program by working in sync with our teammates over git hub.

We did the work department planning and task distribution using trello.
