# Class_3_team_3_project_3

Infotech data science course - Project-3

We have developed a program using Python, where we designed the interface using PyQt5, fetched real-time weather information using an API, and used Scrapy to scrape information about the selected city and store it in a MongoDB database.

We also retrieved information about states, regions, and populations of Holland, America, and Germany from Wikipedia and stored them in tables in MongoDB.

When the program is run, it first displays a list of registered cities in a table widget.
Then, when we select a city from the sorted list, we fetch the real-time weather information using an API and display it on our interface along with a background image that matches the current weather condition.

Furthermore, the user can also search for a city by typing its name. They can type the name of the city, click on the search button, and run the program to retrieve the weather information for that city.

We worked collaboratively with our team members using GitHub to synchronize our work.

We used Trello to plan and distribute tasks among our team members.
