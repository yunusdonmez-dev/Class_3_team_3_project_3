          Daily Task Planning and Meetings

We used Trello to plan and distribute tasks among our team members.
We created daily task boards on Trello and assigned tasks to team members, and 
used the platform to track progress and ensure that we met our project deadlines.
We also held daily Zoom meetings to discuss progress, ask questions, and plan next steps.
