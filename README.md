           Project Structure

The WeatherApp project was developed using Python, PyQt5, Scrapy, and MongoDB.
The user interface was designed using PyQt5, and real-time weather information was fetched using an API. 
Information about states, regions, and populations of Holland, America, and
Germany was retrieved from Wikipedia and stored in tables in MongoDB.
Scrapy was used to scrape information about the selected city and store it in the database.

          Daily Task Planning and Meetings

We used Trello to plan and distribute tasks among our team members.
We created daily task boards on Trello and assigned tasks to team members, and 
used the platform to track progress and ensure that we met our project deadlines.
We also held daily Zoom meetings to discuss progress, ask questions, and plan next steps.
